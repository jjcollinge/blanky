Enrich Azure Service Fabric for developers

Principals
---------------

- Make using service fabric services simple
- Nuget based install (overlays existing templates rather than rewrite - like polyfill in js)
- Highlight cool but unapproachable SF features (naming service, named service instances, watchdogs etc)
- Extend the service fabric REST API to add more features (deployment)
- Provide a best practice template which adds rich features like swagger to each of your services
